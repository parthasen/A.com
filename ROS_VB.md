1. Robot: perception, decision making and actuation
2. ROS master manager of al the nodes.
3. Parameter server acts as a central repository where nodes of a system can look up the parameter value and configuration values as needed.
4. Nodes pass messages to one another. Messages can carry any type of data.
5. A single node may simultaneously publish and subscribe to many topics.
6. Service is between nodes like topic but uses request-response.
7. Topic uses pub-sub architecture
8. rqt_graph helps to get compute graph.

#### Starting the Master process

Before any ROS nodes can be run, the Master process must be started.

The Master process is responsible for the following (and more)

    Providing naming and registration services to other running nodes
    Tracking all publishers and subscribers
    Aggregating log messages generated by the nodes
    Facilitating connections between nodes

To run the master process, you must execute the command `roscore`


#### Running Nodes

Now that the ROS master is running, we can run our  ROS nodes. To do so, we will execute the `rosrun` command in a new terminal window, passing as parameters the name of the package we wish to run, and the name of the actual node.

#### Listing all Active Nodes

To get a list of all nodes that are active and have been registered with the ROS Master, we can use the command `rosnode list`. 
#### Listing All Topics
In a similar fashion, we are able to query the ROS Master for a list of all topics. To do so, we use the command `rostopic` list.
